# XRPL-XRP-Informers-on-X(Twitter)

## Purpose

A compiled list of relevant people who provide up-to-date information on all things XRPL and XRP. 

**Note**: This list isn't exhaustive. It's a personal tool for keeping track of accounts to follow. If you're on this list and wish to be removed, please contact the list owner. Feel free to use and share this list to promote genuine information within the community.
If the list contains a member you believe shouldn't be here please let me know. The list is not here to promote any project, so if a project lead is listed here it is for the value added content they add regarding the XRPL and/or XRP and is in no way intended as a  reflection of their project.

There will be some names in this list who provide unwarranted hype, but generally their content is up to date and relevant. The list generally excludes those accounts who only share price, perceived value or charting information.
